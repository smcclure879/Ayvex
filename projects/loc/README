was trying to run as separate service, had to integrate into simpleServer for expediency,
which led to work with ngssl project.

so now i am back here to make loc (and soon wol) run as separate little subservices or
like the "fireAndForget" things called from simpleServer.
(but will also want to avoid lots of subprocesses...maybe look at dietjs?)


1. service worker....can i get it working for this laptop, all local? (smaller nginx.conf, smaller nodejs, and  a simple_test_servWorker.js )
   bugbug you are here.......
   a. shoudl I go off into a branch to figure it out them come back??? no
   b. this sw special to localhost
   c. simpler? newer code? polyfil?
   d. only real goals: is easy to upgrade on all clients?  maybe a way to grab a client machine back if sub is lost?  machine ID?  not related to crypto id?  like rand cookie?  friendly, not particularly secure


2. can service worker query the location? and transmit it back?

3. get wol callable as web service.

4. cert needs more domains for more experiments, although i think i can use the "folders" part of url now
